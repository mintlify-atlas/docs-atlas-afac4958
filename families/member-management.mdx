## Overview

Member management involves adding new people to the care team, creating their profiles, assigning roles and access levels, and managing their participation over time. Each member needs both a routing.json entry and a member profile.

## Adding a New Member

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Entry to routing.json">
    Add the new member's phone number to the `members` dictionary:
    
    ```json
    {
      "family_id": "kano",
      "members": {
        "+16517037981": {
          "name": "Liban",
          "role": "primary_caregiver",
          "access_level": "full",
          "active": true,
          "chat_id": "1965f2b5-c5e6-4a08-80e9-9224b8a20d88"
        },
        "+16516214824": {
          "name": "Roman Tefera",
          "role": "family_caregiver",
          "access_level": "schedule+meds",
          "active": true,
          "relationship": "sister of care recipient"
        }
      },
      "care_recipient": "Degitu",
      "status": "active",
      "created": "2026-02-25"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Member Profile">
    Create a new profile file at `members/{name}.md`:
    
    ```markdown
    # Roman Tefera — Member Profile
    
    ## Identity
    - Name: Roman Tefera
    - Phone: +16516214824
    - Role: family_caregiver
    - Relationship to care recipient: sister
    - Access level: schedule+meds
    
    ## Communication Preferences
    - Preferred channel:
    - Language:
    - Response time expectations:
    - Preferred notification hours:
    
    ## Care Responsibilities
    <!-- What Roman handles day-to-day — learned through conversation -->
    
    ## Personal Context
    <!-- Context that helps CareSupport be human, not clinical -->
    
    ## Interaction History
    - 2026-02-26: Added to Degitu's care team by Liban.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Care Team in family.md">
    Add the member to the Care Team table in family.md:
    
    ```markdown
    ## Care Team
    
    | Role | Name | Phone | Access Level | Hours | Active |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Primary caregiver | Liban | +16517037981 | full | | ✓ |
    | Family caregiver | Roman Tefera | +16516214824 | schedule+meds | | ✓ |
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Introduction Message">
    Establish chat_id and welcome the new member:
    
    ```bash
    python runtime/scripts/linq_gateway.py create \
      --to "+16516214824" \
      --body "Hi Roman, welcome to CareSupport! Liban has added you to Degitu's care team." \
      --service iMessage
    ```
    
    Update routing.json with the returned `chat_id`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Member Roles

CareSupport supports five distinct roles, each with different responsibilities and permissions:

<ParamField path="primary_caregiver" type="role">
  **Primary Caregiver** — Main coordinator for the care recipient. Typically has full access and approval authority.
  
  - Full access to all sections of family.md
  - Can approve care plan changes
  - Receives escalations for unresolved gaps
  - Default access level: `full`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="family_caregiver" type="role">
  **Family Caregiver** — Family member involved in care but may have limited access to sensitive medical information.
  
  - Access to schedule, medications (depending on access_level)
  - Cannot approve care plan changes by default
  - Typical access levels: `schedule+meds`, `schedule`, or `limited`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="professional_caregiver" type="role">
  **Professional Caregiver** — Paid caregiver providing professional services.
  
  - Access to schedule and care notes relevant to their shifts
  - Can log sessions and document care activities
  - Typical access level: `schedule+meds` or `provider`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="community_supporter" type="role">

  - Limited access to non-medical information
  - Can help with errands, transportation, social visits
  - Typical access level: `schedule` or `limited`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="care_recipient" type="role">
  **Care Recipient** — The person receiving care (may also coordinate their own care).
  
  - Can have full or limited access depending on preference
  - May serve as primary coordinator in some families
</ParamField>

## Member Schema Reference

Each member in routing.json requires these fields:

<ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
  Display name used in prompts, logs, and messages. Can include full name (e.g., "Roman Tefera") or first name only.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="role" type="enum" required>
  One of: `primary_caregiver`, `family_caregiver`, `professional_caregiver`, `community_supporter`, `care_recipient`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="access_level" type="enum" required>
  Determines what sections of family.md this member can see. Options:
  - `full` — All sections, can approve changes
  - `schedule+meds` — Schedule, medications, appointments, urgent notes
  - `schedule` — Schedule and urgent notes only
  - `provider` — Medical info, medications, appointments, care team
  - `limited` — Members and care recipient basic info only
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="active" type="boolean" required>
  Whether this member receives messages. Set to `false` to temporarily disable without removing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="chat_id" type="string" optional>
  Linq chat UUID, populated after first message exchange. Used for reliable message routing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="relationship" type="string" optional>
  Relationship to care recipient (e.g., "grandson", "sister", "neighbor"). Helps personalize agent responses.
</ParamField>

## Role Assignment via Agent

Members can be added through conversation with the agent:

```
Coordinator: "Add my sister Roman to the care team. Her number is +16516214824."

Agent processes routing_updates field:
{
  "routing_updates": [
    {
      "action": "add",
      "phone": "+16516214824",
      "name": "Roman",
      "role": "family_caregiver",
      "relationship": "sister",
      "access_level": "schedule+meds"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The agent uses conservative defaults: `role=family_caregiver` and `access_level=schedule+meds` unless the coordinator specifies otherwise. The coordinator can always adjust these later.
</Note>

## Updating Member Information

Member profiles grow through interaction. The agent updates profiles via `member_updates`:

```json
{
  "member_updates": [
    {
      "member": "Roman",
      "field": "care_responsibilities",
      "value": "Handles weekday morning medication reminders and accompanies to medical appointments."
    },
    {
      "member": "Roman",
      "field": "communication_preferences",
      "value": "Prefers evening check-ins after 6pm. Responds quickly to urgent matters."
    }
  ]
}
```

The system automatically:
1. Validates the member exists in routing.json
2. Updates the appropriate section in `members/{name}.md`
3. Logs the update to the member's Interaction History
4. Triggers `_persist_member_updates()` in sms_handler.py

## Deactivating Members

To temporarily remove a member from active participation:

1. Set `"active": false` in routing.json
2. Update family.md Care Team table (remove ✓ or mark inactive)
3. Add note to member's profile: "Temporarily inactive as of {date}: {reason}"

<Warning>
  Do NOT delete member entries or profiles. Historical context is valuable. Use the `active` flag to control participation.
</Warning>

## Example: Multi-Member Family

Here's a complete routing.json for a family with diverse roles:

```json
{
  "family_id": "kano",
  "members": {
    "+16517037981": {
      "name": "Liban",
      "role": "primary_caregiver",
      "access_level": "full",
      "active": true,
      "relationship": "grandson",
      "chat_id": "1965f2b5-c5e6-4a08-80e9-9224b8a20d88"
    },
    "+16516214824": {
      "name": "Roman Tefera",
      "role": "family_caregiver",
      "access_level": "schedule+meds",
      "active": true,
      "relationship": "sister of care recipient"
    },
    "+16514109390": {
      "name": "Solan Kano",
      "role": "family_caregiver",
      "access_level": "limited",
      "active": true,
      "relationship": "contacted via outreach"
    },
    "+19522157878": {
      "name": "Amanti Melkamu",
      "role": "community_supporter",
      "access_level": "schedule",
      "active": true,
      "relationship": "community_helper",
      "chat_id": "753c8dcf-b13e-4727-b85a-a4f253db0eca"
    }
  },
  "care_recipient": "Degitu",
  "status": "active",
  "created": "2026-02-25"
}
```

This family has:
- 1 primary caregiver (full access)
- 2 family caregivers (different access levels)
- 1 community supporter (limited, schedule-only)

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Coordinator Confirmation Required** — The agent should NEVER add members without explicit coordinator request including name and phone number.
</Warning>

- Start with conservative access levels; expand as needed
- Use `relationship` field to capture family context
- Let profiles grow organically through conversation
- Document timezone differences in Personal Context
- Note communication preferences (texting vs calling, hours, urgency thresholds)
