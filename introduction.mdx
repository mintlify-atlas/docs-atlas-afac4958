## Care coordination that just works

CareSupport is an AI agent that coordinates care teams over SMS and iMessage. Family members, caregivers, and agencies text a single number. The agent tracks schedules, medications, handoffs, and escalations — writing everything to `family.md` files that serve as the operational database.

**No apps to download. No portals to log into. Just text messages.**

<Note>
  **Files, not databases:** Every family's care context lives in markdown files. This means you can read, version control, and audit everything with standard tools.
</Note>

## The agent's job

When someone texts CareSupport, the agent follows a 4-step loop:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Listen">
    Understand what they need — not just what they said. "Can you check with Solan about Monday?" means: contact Solan, ask about Monday, report back.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reason">
    Figure out what's required. Do we have Solan's number? What context from the family file matters? What's missing?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Act or Clarify">
    Have what we need → do it. Missing something critical → ask for exactly that one thing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Close the loop">
    Confirm what happened. "Messaged Solan about Monday" or "Added to the schedule" or "Asked Solan — I'll let you know when he replies."
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  CareSupport is **not** a medical decision-making system. It coordinates care teams and tracks information — it does not diagnose, prescribe, or make clinical judgments.
</Warning>
