# Check-Ins & Daily Monitoring

CareSupport performs regular check-ins with your care team to track daily wellness, coordinate handoffs between caregivers, and identify patterns over time.

## Daily Check-In Protocol

Regular wellness check-ins with care team members.

**Safety level:** Standard  
**Requires approval:** No (informational gathering)

### Default Schedule

- **Morning check-in** (default 8am): Ask current caregiver about overnight/morning
- **Evening check-in** (default 8pm): Summarize the day, prep for overnight

<Info>
Schedules are customizable per family. If your morning caregiver arrives at 7am, check-in can move to 7:15am. If you prefer a 9pm evening check-in, that works too.
</Info>

### Morning Check-In Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="System identifies current caregiver">
    Reads care plan → who is currently with care recipient?
    
    Sends to that person (not always primary caregiver)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Asks about overnight and morning">
    ```
    Good morning Sarah 🌅
    How did Mom sleep last night?
    Any concerns this morning?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Records response in care plan">
    Logs in Recent Updates section with timestamp
    
    If concerning (poor sleep, pain, confusion) → also adds to Urgent Notes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reminds of today's schedule">
    "Today: PT appointment at 2pm, aide Maria arriving at 10am"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Proactive scanning">
    While checking in, also scans for:
    - Medication refills due within 7 days
    - Appointments in next 2 days
    - Overdue follow-ups (>14 days without appointment)
    - Condition tracking thresholds approaching
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
System: Good morning Sarah 🌅
        How did Mom sleep last night?
        Any concerns this morning?
        
Sarah:  Slept okay but seems more confused than usual
        
System: Thanks for letting me know. I've noted the confusion. 
        Keep an eye on it and let me know if it continues.
        
        Today: Physical therapy at 2pm. 
        
        Also - Mom's Metformin refill is due in 5 days. 
        Want me to request it from the pharmacy?
        
Sarah:  yes please
        
System: Requested ✅ Main Street Pharmacy says it will be 
        ready Thursday.
```

### Evening Check-In Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="System reads current care plan section">
    Reviews Recent Updates from today
    
    Compiles day summary
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Messages primary caregiver with summary">
    ```
    Evening update for Mom:
    - Meals: Ate well at breakfast and lunch, light dinner
    - Meds: All confirmed ✓
    - Mood: Alert this morning, more tired this afternoon
    - Tomorrow: Dr. Smith cardiology 2pm
    
    Any concerns tonight?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Flags any missed items">
    If medications were missed or meals skipped → notes in Urgent Notes
    
    If pattern emerging → flags to primary caregiver
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reminds of tomorrow's first task">
    "Tomorrow morning: Remember to give morning meds at 8am"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
System: Evening update for Mom:
        - Meals: Ate well at breakfast and lunch, light dinner
        - Meds: All confirmed ✓  
        - Mood: Alert this morning, more confused this afternoon
        - Tomorrow: Physical therapy at 2pm
        
        Any concerns tonight?
        
Sarah:  The confusion is still there. Should I be worried?
        
System: It's good you're tracking it. If it gets worse or she 
        seems disoriented, let me know immediately. Otherwise, 
        mention it to Dr. Smith at Thursday's appointment.
        
        Want me to add that to the questions list?
        
Sarah:  yes
        
System: Added to "For Next Visit" ✓
```

### Adaptive Behavior

Check-ins adapt to your family's communication style:

**Adjusts to response patterns:**
- If family responds with one-word answers consistently → shortens check-ins
- If family shares detailed updates → matches their level of detail
- Weekend vs weekday tone can differ (more relaxed on weekends)

**Increases frequency when needed:**
- After a bad night or incident → checks in more frequently that day
- During illness or recovery → daily check-ins become twice-daily
- After hospital discharge → enhanced monitoring for first week

**Respects quiet times:**
- Doesn't check in during times family has asked for quiet
- See Care Preferences in care plan

**Example of adaptation:**
```
[After several days of brief responses]

System: Quick morning check — how's Mom doing?
        
Sarah:  good
        
System: Great ✓ PT at 2pm today.

[More concise than usual detailed check-in]
```

### Data Tracking

Each check-in records in Recent Updates:

```
2/28 8:15am: Morning check-in — slept well, ate breakfast, 
meds on time. Sarah reporting.

2/28 8:20pm: Evening check-in — ate light dinner, all meds 
confirmed, mood good. Tomorrow: PT at 2pm. Sarah reporting.
```

Over time, patterns emerge that system flags monthly to primary caregiver:

**Pattern tracking:**
- Sleep quality trends ("Mom's sleep has improved since medication change")
- Missed medication frequency ("Meds missed 3 times in past month - all evening doses")
- Mood patterns ("Increased confusion on Tuesdays - day after aide visits")
- Appetite changes ("Eating less at dinner for past 2 weeks")

**Monthly summary example:**
```
System: Monthly patterns for Mom:
        
        ✓ Sleep: Improved - averaging 7 hours vs 5.5 last month
        ⚠ Medications: Missed 3 evening doses (Mon, Wed, Fri)
        ✓ Mood: Stable, alert most days
        ⚠ Appetite: Dinner portions decreasing
        
        Worth mentioning any of these to Dr. Smith?
```

### Proactive Scanning

During each check-in, system also checks care plan for:

<Accordion title="Medication Refills Due">
**Scans:** Any "Refill Due" dates within 7 days

**Action:** Alerts during check-in

**Example:**
```
System: Morning check-in — how did Mom sleep?
        
        Also: Metformin refill due in 5 days. Want me to request it?
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Upcoming Appointments">
**Scans:** Anything in next 2 days

**Action:** Reminds during check-in

**Example:**
```
System: Evening update for Mom... [summary]
        
        Reminder: Cardiology appointment tomorrow at 2pm with Dr. Smith.
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Overdue Follow-Ups">
**Scans:** Any "For Next Visit" items older than 14 days without scheduled appointment

**Action:** Suggests scheduling

**Example:**
```
System: Morning check-in — how's Mom doing?
        
        Also: It's been 3 weeks since you wanted to ask Dr. Patel 
        about the dizziness. Want me to help schedule a follow-up?
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Condition Tracking Thresholds">
**Scans:** Any progressive condition metric approaching documented concern threshold

**Action:** Flags to primary caregiver

**Example:**
```
System: Morning check-in — how's Mom?
        
        Also: Her weight has been trending down - now 142 lbs 
        (from 148 two weeks ago). Dr. Smith wanted to know if 
        she dropped below 145. Worth a call to the office?
```
</Accordion>

### Caregiver Wellness Check

When primary caregiver is also the person responding to check-ins, system periodically (every 3-5 days) includes a caregiver-focused question:

```
"And how are YOU doing, Sarah? Don't forget to take care of yourself too."
```

**If caregiver expresses burnout, exhaustion, or emotional distress:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Acknowledge it">
    Don't redirect to care recipient immediately
    
    "That sounds really hard. Caregiving is exhausting."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Offer practical help">
    "Want me to look into respite care options?"
    
    "Should we see if other family members can take some shifts?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check for red flags">
    If Caregiver Health Notes exist in care plan → review for concerning patterns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Log in care plan">
    Caregiver wellness is care-relevant data
    
    Records in Recent Updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
```
System: Evening update for Mom... [summary]
        
        And how are YOU doing, Sarah?
        
Sarah:  honestly exhausted. haven't had a full night sleep in weeks
        
System: That sounds really hard. Caregiving is exhausting, and 
        you're doing a lot.
        
        Would it help to look into respite care options? Even a 
        few hours a week can make a difference.
        
Sarah:  maybe. i don't even know where to start
        
System: I can research local respite care programs that take 
        Mom's insurance. Want me to do that?
```

### Cognitive Impairment Notifications

If care recipient texts independently during high-risk hours (10pm-6am):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Respond normally and warmly">
    Never make them feel they're doing something wrong
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send silent notification to primary caregiver">
    "Mom texted at 2:15am: 'Where is everyone?' Just letting you know."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Do NOT tell care recipient you're notifying someone">
    Unless safety requires it (they're trying to leave house, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
This is a soft rule - primary caregiver can disable these notifications if they prefer. Default is ON for care recipients with documented cognitive impairment.
</Info>

## Caregiver Handoff Protocol

Manage shift transitions between caregivers.

**Safety level:** Standard  
**Requires approval:** No

### When It Triggers

- Scheduled shift change (from care_schedules)
- Manual request: "I'm heading out, Maria is taking over"

### Handoff Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="System compiles since last handoff">
    Reads care plan Recent Updates:
    - Meals (what, when)
    - Medications (confirmed? missed?)
    - Mood and behavior
    - Any incidents or concerns
    - Upcoming tasks for next shift
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Messages outgoing caregiver">
    ```
    Before you go — quick summary for handoff:
    
    [Auto-generated from today's data]
    
    Anything to add that Maria should know?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Messages incoming caregiver">
    ```
    Handoff from Sarah:
    - Last meal: Lunch at 12:30 (ate well)
    - Meds: Morning dose confirmed, evening due at 8pm  
    - Mood: Alert and chatty this morning
    - Concerns: None today
    - Next up: Evening meds at 8pm
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Logs handoff in care plan">
    Records in Recent Updates with timestamp and both caregivers' names
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
Sarah:  heading out, Maria is here
        
System: Before you go — quick summary for handoff:
        - Last meal: Lunch 12:30 (ate well)
        - Meds: Morning confirmed, evening at 8pm
        - Mood: Good today, alert
        - Concerns: None
        
        Anything to add that Maria should know?
        
Sarah:  she's been asking about her sister a lot today
        
System: Got it, thanks Sarah.
        
        [To Maria]
        Handoff from Sarah:
        - Last meal: Lunch 12:30 (ate well)  
        - Meds: Morning ✓, evening due at 8pm
        - Mood: Alert and good today
        - Note: Asking about her sister frequently today
        - Next up: Evening meds at 8pm
```

### What a Good Handoff Includes

**Always:**
- Last meal (time and what)
- Medication status (confirmed or missed)
- Mood (alert, tired, confused, agitated, etc.)

**If applicable:**
- Any falls or incidents
- Bathroom assistance timing
- Pain level or pain medication given
- Visitors or phone calls

**Upcoming:**
- Next medication due time
- Appointments or scheduled visitors
- Specific tasks for incoming caregiver

**Context (the most valuable part):**
- "She's been asking about her sister today" - emotional context
- "He was frustrated this morning but settled down after breakfast"
- "She seems more tired than usual"

This qualitative information helps incoming caregiver understand what kind of day/shift to expect.

### Missed Handoff

If outgoing caregiver doesn't respond to handoff prompt:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait 15 minutes">
    Give them time - they might be driving home
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compile automated summary">
    Use data logged throughout the day
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send to incoming with note">
    "Auto-generated from today's logs (couldn't reach Sarah)"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Alert primary caregiver if pattern repeats">
    If same caregiver misses handoff 3+ times → notify primary
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rotating/New Staff Identity Verification

For professional caregivers (agency aides, rotating CNAs):

**First message from new phone number claiming to be staff:**

<Warning>
**Do NOT share any PHI until identity is confirmed.**
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify identity">
    "Hi! Can you confirm the agency name and the client's name?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check against care plan">
    If agency is documented in care plan AND name is correct → proceed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If not documented, escalate">
    "I'll need to check with Sarah before sharing information. Just a moment."
    
    Immediately notify primary caregiver
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Once verified, proceed with filtered access">
    For known rotating staff (documented with phone numbers) → normal handoff
    
    Access-level filtered per their documented role
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
```
[New number texts]: hi this is Maria from HomeHealth, starting shift

System: Hi Maria! Can you confirm the client's name?
        
Maria:  Mrs. Johnson
        
System: Thanks! [Proceeds with handoff]
        
[Or if suspicious]:

System: Thanks! Let me verify with the family. One moment.
        
        [To primary caregiver]:
        Someone claiming to be Maria from HomeHealth just texted. 
        Were you expecting a new aide today?
```

### Cold-Start Orientation for New Caregivers

When a new caregiver joins the care team for the first time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide comprehensive orientation summary">
    Access-level filtered, includes:
    - Care recipient name, conditions, mobility status
    - Current medications + schedule (if schedule+meds access)
    - Daily routine and preferences
    - Emergency protocols customized to this family
    - Key things that work well ("She responds to music")
    - Things to avoid ("Don't mention the nursing home")
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask if they have questions">
    "Any questions before your shift starts?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check in 1 hour into first shift">
    "How is everything going? Any questions?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="End-of-first-shift: extra-detailed handoff prompt">
    Gather observations: "How did the shift go? Anything we should know for next time?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example orientation:**
```
System: Welcome Maria! Quick orientation for Mrs. Johnson:
        
        - 78 years old, lives at home with daughter Sarah
        - Conditions: Heart failure, diabetes, early dementia
        - Mobility: Needs assistance standing/walking, uses walker
        - Medications: 3 times daily (I'll remind you when due)
        - Routine: Breakfast 8am, lunch 12pm, dinner 6pm
        - She loves talking about her garden and her grandkids
        - Please don't mention her late husband - it upsets her
        
        Emergency: If she has chest pain or trouble breathing, 
        call 911 immediately and text me. Address is 123 Oak St.
        
        Any questions before you start?
        
Maria:  What should I do if she refuses to eat?
        
System: Good question. Try offering smaller portions or her 
        favorite foods (she likes oatmeal and soup). If she 
        refuses multiple meals, let Sarah know. Don't force it.
        
Maria:  got it thanks
        
System: You're all set! I'll check in with you in an hour.
        
[1 hour later]
        
System: How's everything going, Maria?
```

## Integration with Other Protocols

Check-ins and handoffs work with:

- **Medication Management**: Reports medication compliance in daily summaries
- **Wellness Monitoring**: Passively collects wellness data from check-in responses
- **Care Schedules**: Agent schedules trigger check-ins at appropriate times
- **Provider Communication**: Identifies items to surface at appointments
- **Emergency Response**: Can trigger emergency protocol if check-in reveals concerning situation
