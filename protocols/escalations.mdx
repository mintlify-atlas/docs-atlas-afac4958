# Emergency Response & Escalations

<Warning>
This is a **critical safety protocol**. It activates IMMEDIATELY on emergency keywords without waiting for confirmation. False positives are acceptable. False negatives are not.
</Warning>

## Emergency Response Protocol

Handle urgent and life-threatening situations.

**Safety level:** Critical  
**Requires approval:** No (emergencies don't wait for approval)

### Hard Safety Rules

These rules are **never overridden**:

<Accordion title="Rule 1: Respond within ONE message, IMMEDIATELY">
**No:**
- "Let me check the care plan first..."
- "Loading information about falls..."
- Waiting to gather context

**Yes:**
- Act immediately
- Gather context after responding

**Why:** In emergencies, every second matters. The system must respond in the first message with actionable guidance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 2: Emergency keywords trigger this protocol unconditionally">
**Even if ambiguous:** "mom fell" → emergency protocol

**False positives are acceptable. False negatives are not.**

Better to activate emergency response unnecessarily than miss a real emergency.

**Compound phrase exceptions:**
- "fell asleep" → NOT a fall emergency
- "taking my breath away" → NOT breathing emergency  
- "bleeding heart" (figurative) → NOT bleeding emergency
- "fall colors" / "fall season" → NOT a fall

When keyword appears in clearly non-emergency compound phrase, ask: "Just to be safe - when you said [phrase], is Mom OK?"
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 3: Notify ALL full-access members simultaneously">
**Don't wait** for one to respond before notifying others

**Parallel notification** to all who need to know

**Why:** In an emergency, family members may be in different locations with different abilities to respond. Cast a wide net.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 4: Never tell someone NOT to call 911">
**If asked:** "Should I call 911?"

**Always respond:** "Yes, call 911 now. I'm notifying the family."

**Never:** "Let's wait and see" or "Try [something else] first"

**Why:** 911 dispatchers are trained to triage. It's better to call and have them say it's not needed than to delay calling when it is needed.
</Accordion>

### Emergency Keywords

These words/phrases trigger immediate emergency response:

```
fall, fell, fallen
chest pain, chest hurts
can't breathe, breathing, short of breath
choking
unresponsive, won't wake, unconscious
seizure, convulsion  
bleeding, blood
stroke, face drooping, arm weakness, speech
help, emergency, 911
allergic reaction, swelling, hives
```

### Emergency Access Override

<Info>
During an active emergency, the on-scene caregiver receives ALL medically-relevant information regardless of their normal access level.
</Info>

This includes:
- Medications (full list with doses)
- Allergies (drug and non-drug)
- Blood type
- Conditions
- Emergency contacts

**Documentation:** System logs "Emergency access override for [member] during [event] at [time]" in PHI access log

**Duration:** Override ends when emergency is resolved

**Notification scope:** For Tier 1 emergencies, ALL care team members at ALL access levels are notified. Everyone needs to know there's a life-threatening situation.

## Three-Tier Emergency Response

### Tier 1: Life-Threatening (Call 911)

**Triggers:**
- Chest pain
- Can't breathe
- Unresponsive
- Seizure
- Stroke symptoms (face/arm/speech)
- Choking
- Severe bleeding
- Allergic reaction

**Immediate response (< 10 seconds):**

<Steps>
  <Step title="First message">
    ```
    Call 911 now.
    Address: [home address from care plan]
    I'm notifying [primary] and [secondary].
    Stay with [recipient]. What's happening right now?
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Simultaneously notify all full-access members">
    "🚨 URGENT: [who reported] reports [situation] with [recipient]. 911 may be needed. [address]"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If provider phone exists and during business hours">
    Notify primary physician
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Log in care plan">
    Recent Updates + Urgent Notes with full details and timeline
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example scenario:**
```
2:15pm  Maria:  help mom cant breathe

2:15pm  System: Call 911 now.
                Address: 123 Oak Street
                I'm notifying Sarah and John.
                Stay with Mrs. Johnson. What's happening right now?
                
2:15pm  [To Sarah]: 🚨 URGENT: Maria reports Mrs. Johnson can't 
                     breathe. 911 may be needed. 123 Oak Street
                     
2:15pm  [To John]: 🚨 URGENT: Maria reports Mrs. Johnson can't 
                    breathe. 911 may be needed. 123 Oak Street
                    
2:16pm  Maria:  she is breathing but very short of breath, 
                wheezing
                
2:16pm  System: Keep her sitting upright. Paramedics are on the way. 
                Does she have her rescue inhaler?
                
                [Also sends to Sarah and John]
```

### Tier 2: Urgent, Not Life-Threatening

**Triggers:**
- Fall (without loss of consciousness)
- Missed multiple medications
- Sudden confusion
- Mild allergic reaction

**Immediate response:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="First message">
    ```
    I hear you. Is [recipient] conscious and breathing normally?
    I'm letting [primary caregiver] know right now.
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notify primary caregiver with details">
    Full situation summary sent immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ask reporter for more details">
    "Can [recipient] move? Any pain? What happened?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Based on response, either escalate to Tier 1 or proceed with care guidance">
    If situation worsens → immediately escalate to Tier 1
    
    If stable → coordinate appropriate care response
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Log everything in care plan">
    Complete timeline in Recent Updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example scenario:**
```
10:30am Maria:  mom fell getting out of bed

10:30am System: I hear you. Is she conscious and breathing normally?
                I'm letting Sarah know right now.
                
10:30am [To Sarah]: Maria reports Mrs. Johnson fell getting 
                     out of bed. Checking details now.
                     
10:31am Maria:  yes shes awake and talking but her hip hurts

10:31am System: Can she move her legs? Did she hit her head?
                
10:31am Maria:  she can move legs. no head hit. just hip pain

10:31am System: [To Maria] Keep her still. Don't let her try to 
                 stand up until Sarah gets there.
                 
                [To Sarah] Mrs. Johnson fell getting out of bed. 
                Conscious, talking, moving legs. Hip pain. No head 
                injury. Maria is with her. May need doctor visit

10:32am Sarah:  on my way, 10 minutes. maria stay with her

10:32am System: [To Maria] Sarah is 10 minutes away. Stay with 
                 Mrs. Johnson and keep her comfortable.
```

### Tier 3: Concerning, Monitor

**Triggers:**
- "help" (without other keywords)
- Unusual behavior report
- Repeated wellness check failures

**Response:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask for more information">
    "Tell me more about what's going on with [recipient]."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assess based on response">
    Could reveal Tier 1 or Tier 2 situation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Escalate if warranted">
    Bump up to appropriate tier based on details
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notify primary caregiver with summary">
    Even if not emergency, keep them informed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add to Urgent Notes if ongoing concern">
    Track for pattern monitoring
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Clinical Knowledge Rule

<Warning>
**Do NOT rely on general medical knowledge for time-critical actions.**

Condition-specific emergency guidance MUST be stored IN the care plan Emergency Protocols section, not left to inference.
</Warning>

**Examples of what must be documented in care plan:**

- **CHF patient:** "Do NOT lay flat. Keep upright."
- **Blood thinner patient:** "Tell 911 which anticoagulant and dose."
- **Diabetes patient:** "If unconscious and low blood sugar suspected, DO NOT give food by mouth."
- **Epilepsy patient:** "Do not restrain. Clear area. Time the seizure."
- **Sulfa allergy:** "Bactrim, Septra, sulfasalazine are contraindicated."

**When onboarding a family:** Populate Emergency Protocols with condition-specific clinical actions based on care recipient's conditions. This is a CRITICAL onboarding step, not optional.

**Example in care plan:**
```
## Emergency Protocols

### Heart Failure
- If shortness of breath: Keep upright, DO NOT lay flat
- Tell 911: "Heart failure patient on Lasix 40mg daily"
- Watch for: Swelling, rapid weight gain, increased fatigue

### Diabetes  
- If confused/unconscious: Check blood sugar if possible
- DO NOT give food/drink by mouth if unconscious
- Tell 911: "Diabetic, takes Metformin 500mg twice daily"
- Keep glucose tablets/juice nearby

### Allergies
- Penicillin → rash, hives (moderate)
- Sulfa drugs → severe reaction, difficulty breathing
- Tell 911 about sulfa allergy immediately if EMS needed
```

---

## Post-Surgical Emergency Guidance

For patients recovering from surgery:

<Info>
If the fall/injury involves the SURGICAL SITE:

**Contact the SURGEON first** (not 911), UNLESS there is:
- Head injury
- Loss of consciousness  
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Severe acute distress

In those cases → call 911 immediately
</Info>

**Provide surgeon with:**
- Surgery date
- Current medications (especially blood thinners)
- Description of the event

**If surgeon says ER needed:**
- Call 911
- Relay surgeon's assessment to paramedics

## After Emergency

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update care plan with outcome">
    Remove from Urgent Notes once resolved
    
    Add comprehensive summary to Recent Updates with full timeline
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If hospitalized, trigger hospitalization protocol">
    Updates This Week schedule
    
    Suspends home care
    
    See Hospitalization Management below
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow up with reporter within 2 hours">
    "Checking in - how is [recipient] doing after earlier? Any updates?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Flag protocol updates if needed">
    If emergency revealed gaps in protocols or contacts → flag for primary caregiver to review
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Hospitalization Management Protocol

Meta-protocol for hospital admission, inpatient stay, and discharge.

**Safety level:** Critical  
**Requires approval:** Yes (discharge medication changes need confirmation)

### Hard Safety Rules

<Warning>
1. **SUSPEND all home medication reminders during inpatient stay**
   - Hospital manages medications
   - Double-dosing from home reminders + hospital administration is dangerous
   - Add all medications to Medication Hold Log with reason: "Hospitalized"

2. **Verify admission status: "admitted" not "observation"**
   - Observation is outpatient - insurance covers differently
   - Can mean thousands more in out-of-pocket costs
   - Medicare requires 3-day inpatient stay for SNF coverage

3. **Medication reconciliation at discharge is MANDATORY**
   - Before resuming home medication reminders
   - Must reconcile ALL medication changes
   - See medication-management protocol for full workflow
</Warning>

### Phase 1: Admission

**Immediate actions within first message exchange:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect essential information">
    - Hospital name
    - Room number (when available)
    - Attending physician
    - Floor nurse / nursing station phone
    - Diagnosis (if known)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Coordinate care transitions">
    - SUSPEND all home medication reminders → add to Hold Log
    - PAUSE home care staff schedule → notify aides
    - CANCEL/RESCHEDULE all upcoming home appointments
    - NOTIFY all care team members (access-appropriate)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide hospital staff with care information">
    Via on-site family member:
    - Full medication list with doses and schedules
    - ALL allergies (drug + non-drug) with severity and reaction type
    - Insurance information (plan, member ID)
    - Primary physician name and phone
    - Emergency contacts
    - Advance directives status (if documented)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update care plan">
    - Urgent Notes: "⚠️ HOSPITALIZED - [hospital], admitted [date]. [diagnosis]."
    - This Week: all entries replaced with hospital status
    - Recent Updates: timestamped admission entry
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
```
Sarah:  Mom is being admitted to General Hospital, heart failure
        
System: I'm handling the coordination. Here's what I'm doing:
        
        ✓ Pausing all home medication reminders
        ✓ Notifying home care aides about pause  
        ✓ Canceling Thursday's PT appointment
        ✓ Letting family know
        
        Focus on being with Mom. 
        
        When you have a moment, the hospital needs:
        - Current medication list (reply MEDS and I'll send it)
        - Insurance card (Medicare + Blue Cross secondary)
        - Allergies: Penicillin, Sulfa drugs
        
        I'll check in with you tomorrow morning.
```

### Phase 2: Inpatient Stay

**Daily during hospitalization:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Morning check-in with family member at hospital">
    "How is Mom this morning? Any updates from the medical team?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Route information between family members">
    On-site family → remote family (access-filtered)
    
    Maintain consistent, calibrated messaging (avoid both minimizing and catastrophizing)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track important information">
    - Diagnosis updates
    - Treatment plan changes
    - Expected discharge date
    - Any new medications started in hospital
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Continue managing non-hospital care needs">
    - Update providers not involved in hospitalization
    - Handle insurance questions
    - Coordinate visitors/family logistics
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Discharge

**When discharge is confirmed:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="CRITICAL: Medication reconciliation">
    See medication-management protocol for full workflow
    
    Must identify:
    - What's NEW (added during hospitalization)
    - What CHANGED (dose adjustments)
    - What was HELD (needs explicit release)
    - What was DISCONTINUED
    
    Run interaction checks on ALL new combinations
    
    Get primary caregiver confirmation for complete updated list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resume home care">
    - Notify home care staff with updated care requirements
    - Prepare discharge summary for returning aides:
      - New medications
      - New restrictions
      - New equipment needs
      - Activity limitations
    - Resume medication reminders with updated schedule
    - Resume home care staff shifts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Schedule follow-ups">
    - Discharge follow-up with hospitalist/attending
    - Follow-up with primary physician
    - Specialist follow-ups as ordered
    - Lab work as ordered
    - Home health/PT if prescribed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update care plan comprehensively">
    - Remove hospitalization from Urgent Notes
    - Add comprehensive discharge summary to Recent Updates
    - Update Active Medications with reconciled list
    - Release medication holds in Hold Log
    - Update This Week with new schedule
    - Add hospitalization summary to Past Appointments
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example discharge conversation:**
```
Sarah:  Good news - Mom is being discharged today!
        
System: Great news! Before she comes home, I need the medication 
        list from discharge papers. What changed?
        
Sarah:  [Sends photo of discharge instructions]
        
System: Reading... Got it. Let me verify:
        
        NEW: Lasix 40mg daily (diuretic for heart failure)
        INCREASED: Lisinopril 10mg → 20mg
        SAME: Metformin 500mg twice daily
        DISCONTINUED: None
        
        Checking interactions with new combination...
        ✓ No interactions found
        
        Times for the Lasix?
        
Sarah:  Morning with breakfast
        
System: Perfect. I'd like to update Mom's medications per 
        hospital discharge. Reply YES to confirm.
        
Sarah:  YES
        
System: Updated ✅
        
        Resuming medication reminders:
        - Morning 8am: Lasix 40mg, Metformin 500mg
        - Evening 8pm: Lisinopril 20mg, Metformin 500mg
        
        I've notified home care aides about the changes.
        Maria's shift resumes tomorrow at 9am.
        
        When is the follow-up with Dr. Smith?
        
Sarah:  Next week Thursday at 10am
        
System: Added to schedule ✅ I'll send reminders.
```

## Why This Matters

**Emergency response:**
- **Every 5 minutes** delay in stroke treatment increases disability risk by 10%
- **Falls** are the leading cause of injury death for older adults
- **Medication reconciliation errors** cause 20% of adverse drug events

**Hospitalization:**
- **40% of medication errors** occur during care transitions
- **Observation status** can cost $5,000+ more than admission for same care
- **Hospital readmissions** within 30 days affect 20% of Medicare patients

This protocol exists to:
- Minimize emergency response time
- Ensure appropriate escalation
- Prevent medication errors during transitions
- Coordinate care during high-stress situations
