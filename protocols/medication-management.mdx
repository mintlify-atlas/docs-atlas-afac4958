# Medication Management Protocol

<Warning>
This is the **highest-stakes protocol** in CareSupport. It has hard safety rules that are mechanically enforced and never overridden by reasoning. Medication errors can be fatal.
</Warning>

## Overview

The medication management protocol handles all medication-related coordination:
- Tracking active medications
- Sending reminders at scheduled times
- Recording doses taken
- Managing medication changes
- Checking drug interactions
- Tracking refills
- Managing medication holds (surgery, hospitalization, emergencies)
- Reconciling medications after hospital discharge

**Safety level:** Critical  
**Requires approval:** Yes (for changes only - recording doses taken does NOT require approval)

## Hard Safety Rules

These rules are **never overridden** for any reason:

<Accordion title="Rule 1: Never update medications without prescriber order + primary caregiver confirmation">
**Applies to:**
- New medication additions
- Dose changes
- Discontinuations

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Recording "med taken"
- Logging administration times

**Important:** Full access ≠ medication change authority. A family member saying "increase the dose" is NOT sufficient. A prescriber must order it first.

**Example of proper flow:**
```
Family: "Dr. Smith increased Mom's Lisinopril to 20mg"
System: Verifies Lisinopril exists in active meds
System: Checks interactions with new dose
System: "I'd like to update Mom's file: Lisinopril 10mg → 20mg, 
         per Dr. Smith. Reply YES to confirm."
Primary: "YES"
System: Updates meds + logs in history + notifies care team
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 2: Always check drug interactions AND food-drug interactions">
**Before confirming any medication change:**

1. Call interaction checker with full active med list + new medication
2. Check DIETARY interactions:
   - MAO inhibitors + tyramine
   - Warfarin + vitamin K
   - Methotrexate + folate-rich foods
   - Statins + grapefruit
   - And many more
3. Check allergy list in family file EVERY TIME. No exceptions.
4. If interaction found → alert immediately, do NOT add to file

**Example:**
```
System: Checking Lisinopril 20mg against active medications...
System: ⚠️ INTERACTION FOUND: Lisinopril + potassium supplements 
        can cause dangerous potassium levels. Dr. Smith needs to 
        know Mom is taking potassium. Holding this change until 
        we verify with the doctor.
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 3: Always include drug name AND dose in every medication message">
**Wrong:**
- "Time for Mom's meds"
- "Evening meds are due"

**Correct:**
- "Time for Mom's Lisinopril 10mg"
- "Evening meds due: Metformin 500mg and Atorvastatin 20mg"

**Why:** Prevents administration errors. Caregiver can verify they have the right medication and dose.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 4: Never relay medication advice">
**When family asks medication questions:**

❌ "You can probably take an extra one"
❌ "That side effect is normal, keep taking it"
❌ "You should switch to taking it at night"

✅ "That's a question for Dr. [Name]. Want me to message them?"
✅ "I'll help you coordinate with the pharmacist about that"

**The system coordinates. It does not prescribe.**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 5: Adjust instruction depth by administrator">
**If medication will be given by trained provider (RN, certified CNA):**
- Standard reminders: "Time for [med] [dose]"

**If medication will be given by family member or untrained caregiver:**
- Include detailed guidance:
  - Injection technique if applicable
  - Timing with food ("Take with food" or "On empty stomach")
  - What to watch for ("Monitor for dizziness for 1 hour")
  - Special instructions ("Shake well" or "Don't crush")

**System checks who is currently on-shift before sending reminders** to ensure appropriate detail level.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rule 6: Side effect reports from cognitively impaired recipients are VALID">
If the care recipient says:
- "This makes me feel foggy"
- "I don't like how this makes me feel"
- Any symptom description

**Action:** Log it and route to the prescriber. Cognitive impairment does NOT invalidate self-reported side effects.
</Accordion>

## When This Protocol Activates

The protocol triggers automatically when messages contain:
- Medication names (matched against active medications in care plan)
- Keywords: meds, medicine, pill, prescription, refill, pharmacy, dose, taken, missed, side effect
- Scheduled medication reminder time (from care schedules)

## Workflows

### Recording a Dose Taken

The most common medication interaction - confirming a medication was administered.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Caregiver confirms">
    Member texts: "done" or "taken" or "Lisinopril done"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System matches medication">
    Reads active medications from care plan
    
    Matches to scheduled medication for current time window (±2 hours)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Updates care plan">
    Updates "Last Confirmed" timestamp with current time
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirms to caregiver">
    "Got it ✅ Lisinopril 10mg logged at 8:15am"
    
    If multiple meds were due: "Also the Metformin 500mg?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
System: Hi Sarah, time for Mom's Lisinopril 10mg. Reply DONE when taken ✅
Sarah:  done
System: Got it ✅ Lisinopril 10mg logged at 8:15am
```

### Missed Medication Alert

When a medication isn't confirmed within the expected window:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scheduled time + 1 hour passes">
    Care schedule fires at [scheduled time + 1 hour] with no confirmation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System identifies current caregiver">
    Reads care plan → who is currently with care recipient?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sends gentle check-in">
    "Mom's Lisinopril 10mg was due at 8am. Has it been taken?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Escalates if no response">
    If no response in 30 minutes → escalates to primary caregiver
    
    Logs outcome in care plan Recent Updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
8:00am  System: Hi Sarah, time for Mom's Lisinopril 10mg...
9:00am  [No response received]
9:00am  System: Mom's Lisinopril 10mg was due at 8am. Has it been taken?
9:05am  Sarah:  oh yes, gave it at 8:30, sorry!
9:05am  System: Got it ✅ Logged at 8:30am. No worries!
```

### Medication Change from Provider

When a doctor adjusts medication:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Family reports change">
    "Dr. Smith increased Lisinopril to 20mg"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System verifies existing medication">
    Reads care plan → confirms Lisinopril exists in Active Medications
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Checks interactions">
    Runs interaction check with new dose if dose-dependent interactions exist
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Drafts change for approval">
    "I'd like to update Mom's file: Lisinopril 10mg → 20mg, per Dr. Smith. Reply YES to confirm."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Waits for primary caregiver confirmation">
    Parses YES/Y/yes/yeah/confirm/approved/ok → approve
    
    Parses NO/N/no/nope/cancel/wait → reject
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Updates and notifies">
    Updates Active Medications
    
    Logs in Full Medication History with date and reason
    
    Notifies all team members with schedule+meds access or higher
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
Sarah:  Dr. Smith increased Mom's Lisinopril to 20mg
System: I'd like to update Mom's file: Lisinopril 10mg → 20mg, 
        per Dr. Smith. Reply YES to confirm.
Sarah:  yes
System: Updated ✅ Mom's Lisinopril changed to 20mg starting today.
        [Also notifies other team members]
```

### Adding a New Medication

When a new medication is prescribed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Family reports new medication">
    "Dr. Patel started Mom on Metformin 500mg twice daily"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Runs comprehensive interaction check">
    Checks new medication against ALL active medications
    
    Checks food-drug interactions
    
    Checks allergy list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Collects full medication details">
    - Medication name and dose
    - Schedule (times to take)
    - Prescriber name
    - Reason for medication
    - Special instructions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Drafts addition for approval">
    Shows complete medication details for confirmation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="On approval, sets up automation">
    Adds to Active Medications with all fields
    
    Sets up medication reminders in care_schedules if recurring
    
    Notifies care team
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The system proactively asks for missing information: "What times should Mom take the Metformin?" or "Do you have the pharmacy information?"
</Info>

### Refill Tracking

Proactive medication refill management:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Medication added or refilled">
    System notes fill date and quantity when medication is added/refilled
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Calculates depletion date">
    Formula: fill_date + (quantity / daily_doses)
    
    Example: 90 pills, 1 per day = 90 days until refill needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sends reminder 7 days before depletion">
    "Metformin refill due in 7 days. Want me to request from [pharmacy]?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Coordinates refill">
    On confirmation → calls pharmacy refill system if available
    
    Logs in Recent Updates
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjusts if family reports low supply early">
    If family says "running low" before calculated date, updates tracking
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
```
System: Metformin refill due in 7 days. Want me to request from 
        Main Street Pharmacy?
Sarah:  yes please
System: Requested. Pharmacy says it will be ready Thursday. 
        Want a reminder to pick it up?
```

### Medication Hold

When medications need to be temporarily stopped:

<Warning>
**Triggers:** ER/hospital visit, pre-surgery, provider instruction, safety event

A hold requires EXPLICIT RELEASE - it NEVER auto-resumes.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hold triggered">
    Family reports: "Mom is having surgery tomorrow, doctor said stop the blood thinner"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System updates medication status">
    Updates Active Medications: Status → "held (pre-surgery)"
    
    Adds to Medication Hold Log: medication, date, reason
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Suspends all reminders">
    All automated reminders for held medications STOP immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notifies care team">
    Alerts relevant team members about the hold
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Waits for explicit release">
    Requires provider order OR primary caregiver confirmation to resume
    
    System will NOT prompt to resume - human must initiate
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="On release, resumes carefully">
    Updates Status → "active"
    
    Updates Hold Log with release date
    
    Resumes reminders
    
    Confirms first dose after release
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Hospital-to-Home Medication Reconciliation

One of the most critical medication safety workflows:

<Warning>
Medication errors during care transitions cause thousands of preventable hospitalizations annually. This workflow prevents that.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="At discharge, get complete medication list">
    System prompts: "I need the FULL medication list from discharge papers. What changed?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare against home medications">
    System identifies:
    - **NEW** medications (added during hospitalization)
    - **CHANGED** medications (dose adjustments)
    - **HELD** medications (need explicit release before resuming)
    - **DISCONTINUED** medications (stopped)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check interactions on new combinations">
    For each new medication: runs interaction check against ALL home medications
    
    Flags any concerning combinations immediately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify administration logistics">
    Checks: who will administer each medication at home?
    
    Especially important for injections, IVs, or complex administration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update care plan with reconciled list">
    Updates complete medication list with all changes documented
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notify entire care team">
    ALL team members with relevant medication access receive update about changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resume home medication reminders">
    Restarts automated reminders with updated schedule
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example reconciliation:**
```
System: Welcome home! Before I resume medication reminders, I need 
        the full list from discharge. What medications is Mom taking now?
        
Sarah:  They sent home: Lisinopril 20mg (increased), Metformin 500mg 
        (same), and new one called Atorvastatin 40mg for cholesterol
        
System: Got it. Let me verify against the home medications:
        
        CHANGED: Lisinopril 10mg → 20mg
        SAME: Metformin 500mg twice daily
        NEW: Atorvastatin 40mg once daily
        
        Checking interactions with new combination...
        ✓ No interactions found
        
        Times for the Atorvastatin?
        
Sarah:  Evening with dinner
        
System: Perfect. I'd like to update Mom's medications with these 
        changes per hospital discharge. Reply YES to confirm.
        
Sarah:  YES
        
System: Updated ✅ 
        
        Resuming medication reminders with new schedule:
        - Morning: Metformin 500mg
        - Evening: Lisinopril 20mg, Metformin 500mg, Atorvastatin 40mg
        
        First reminder will be tonight at 6pm.
```

### Location Transition Medication Check

When care recipient moves between locations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="System proactively asks about medication logistics">
    "Will Mom have her 2pm dose with her at the day program?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If medications need to travel">
    Reminds about:
    - Proper labeling
    - Administration instructions
    - Who will give the medication
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="If someone else will administer">
    Verifies they know:
    - Medication name and dose
    - Timing
    - Any special instructions
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
```
Sarah:  Mom is going to adult day care tomorrow 9am-3pm
        
System: Got it, added to schedule. Will Mom have her 2pm Metformin 
        with her at day care?
        
Sarah:  Oh good catch! I'll send it with her
        
System: Perfect. Make sure it's labeled with her name and the dose. 
        Will the day care staff give it to her?
        
Sarah:  Yes they have a nurse
        
System: Great. I'll send you a reminder at 8:30am to pack it.
```

## Message Templates

Standard message formats used by the protocol:

```
Reminder:
"Hi {caregiver_name}, time for {recipient}'s {medication} {dose}. 
Reply DONE when taken ✅"

Missed:
"{recipient}'s {medication} {dose} was due at {time}. Has it been taken?"

Change:
"Updating {recipient}'s meds: {old} → {new}, per Dr. {prescriber}. 
Reply YES to confirm."

Confirmed:
"Got it ✅ {medication} {dose} logged at {time}"

Refill:
"{medication} refill due in {days} days. Want me to request from {pharmacy}?"

Interaction Alert:
"⚠️ INTERACTION FOUND: {medication1} + {medication2} can cause {risk}. 
Dr. {name} needs to verify this is safe. Holding this change until we confirm."
```

## Integration with Other Protocols

Medication management works with:

- **Emergency Response**: Medication holds during emergency situations
- **Hospitalization**: Automatic suspension during inpatient stay + mandatory reconciliation at discharge
- **Care Plan Updates**: All medication changes logged with timestamps and attribution
- **Provider Communication**: Routes medication questions to prescribers, prepares med lists for visits
- **Care Schedules**: Creates and manages medication reminder schedules
- **Daily Check-In**: Reports medication compliance in daily summaries

## For Caregivers

### Quick Actions

**Record a dose:**
- Text "done" or "taken"
- Or text the medication name: "Lisinopril done"

**Report a change:**
- "Dr. Smith changed Mom's Lisinopril to 20mg"
- System will verify and ask for confirmation

**Ask about a medication:**
- "What time is the evening Metformin due?"
- "Did Mom take her morning meds?"

**Report a side effect:**
- "Mom feels dizzy after taking the Lisinopril"
- System logs it and offers to contact prescriber

**Request refill:**
- "Mom is running low on Metformin"
- System can coordinate with pharmacy

### What Gets Confirmed vs What Happens Automatically

**Requires confirmation:**
- New medication additions
- Dose changes
- Discontinuations
- Medication hold releases

**Happens automatically (no confirmation needed):**
- Recording doses taken
- Missed medication alerts
- Refill reminders
- Interaction checks

---

## Why This Matters

Medication management is the highest-stakes coordination work in caregiving:
- **60% of older adults** take 5+ medications daily
- **50% of medications** are not taken as prescribed
- **Medication errors** cause 1.3 million+ emergency visits annually in the US
- **Care transitions** (hospital to home) are the highest-risk time for medication errors

This protocol exists to prevent medication errors through:
- **Clear communication** (always include drug name and dose)
- **Interaction checking** (before every change)
- **Confirmation loops** (prescriber + caregiver for changes)
- **Proactive tracking** (refills, missed doses, patterns)
- **Transition safety** (hospital reconciliation, location changes)

<Info>
**Clinical foundation:** This protocol incorporates evidence-based medication safety practices from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices.
