# Care Protocols Overview

CareSupport uses 16 specialized care protocols to coordinate every aspect of caregiving. Each protocol handles specific situations and triggers automatically when relevant messages arrive.

## How Protocols Work

Protocols are intelligent workflows that:
- **Auto-activate** based on message content and context
- **Coordinate actions** across your care team
- **Enforce safety rules** for medication and emergency situations
- **Track decisions** with timestamps and attribution
- **Adapt to your family** while maintaining clinical safety

<Info>
Protocols work together seamlessly. A single message like "Mom fell and missed her evening meds" triggers both emergency-response and medication-management protocols simultaneously.

## The 16 Care Protocols

### Critical Safety Protocols

These protocols have hard safety rules that are never overridden.

<Accordion title="Medication Management">
**What it handles:** Track, remind, update, and verify all medications

**When it triggers:** Any medication-related message - taken, missed, changed, refill, side effects, or questions

**Key features:**
- Drug interaction checking before any medication change
- Requires prescriber order + primary caregiver confirmation for changes
- Automatic refill tracking and reminders
- Hospital-to-home medication reconciliation
- Medication hold management during emergencies

**Safety rules:**
- Never update medications without prescriber order
- Always check drug AND food interactions
- Always include drug name AND dose in reminders
- Never relay medication advice - coordinate with providers

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Emergency Response">
**What it handles:** Urgent and life-threatening situations

**When it triggers:** Immediately on keywords - fall, chest pain, can't breathe, help, 911, choking, unresponsive, seizure, bleeding

**Key features:**
- Responds within one message, no delays
- Notifies all full-access members simultaneously
- Provides address and emergency information instantly
- Three-tier escalation (life-threatening, urgent, concerning)
- Emergency access override for on-scene caregivers

**Safety rules:**
- Emergency keywords trigger unconditionally (false positives acceptable)
- Never tell someone NOT to call 911
- Act first, gather context second
- Condition-specific protocols stored in family file, not left to inference

### Care Coordination Protocols

These protocols manage day-to-day coordination and scheduling.

<Accordion title="Care Schedules">
**What it handles:** Create and manage recurring reminders - medications, appointments, check-ins, shift handoffs

**When it triggers:** Setting up, modifying, or deleting scheduled tasks

**Two schedule types:**
- **Agent schedules** (needs reasoning): Daily check-ins, wellness analysis, needs assessments
- **Script schedules** (deterministic): Medication reminders, appointment reminders, shift alerts

**Default schedules:**
- Morning check-in (8am): Ask about overnight and today's plan
- Evening check-in (8pm): Day summary and tomorrow's prep
- Medication reminders: Per medication schedule
- Weekly summary: Week in review to primary caregiver

[View scheduling guide →](/protocols/scheduling)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Daily Check-In">
**What it handles:** Regular wellness check-ins with care team

**When it triggers:** Scheduled morning/evening, or when asking about sleep, meals, mood, wellbeing

**Morning check-in:**
- How did care recipient sleep?
- Any concerns this morning?
- Reminder of today's schedule

**Evening check-in:**
- Day summary (meals, meds, mood)
- Missed items flagged
- Tomorrow's first task reminder

**Proactive scanning:** Each check-in also checks for upcoming medication refills, appointments within 2 days, overdue follow-ups, and condition tracking thresholds.

</Accordion>

## Protocol Interactions

Protocols work together automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message arrives">
    System analyzes content and identifies relevant protocols
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Multiple protocols activate">
    Example: "Mom fell and missed her evening meds" triggers emergency-response + medication-management
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Protocols coordinate">
    Emergency-response handles immediate safety while medication-management tracks the missed dose and reschedules
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Actions execute">
    Appropriate team members notified, care plan updated, follow-ups scheduled
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Safety Levels

<Warning>
**Critical protocols** have hard rules that are mechanically enforced and cannot be overridden by reasoning:
- Medication Management
- Emergency Response
- Hospitalization
- Care Plan Updates

These protocols protect health and safety through code gates, not just prompt instructions.
</Warning>

**Standard protocols** follow guidelines by default but can adapt based on family context and agent reasoning.

**Informational protocols** provide reference material and tools without behavioral constraints.

## Protocol Development

New protocols are created when:
- A care pattern emerges that isn't covered
- A family has unique needs
- A provider requests specific monitoring
- Simulation reveals a coordination gap

Every protocol is developed from real care coordination needs, documented in family simulation transcripts.
