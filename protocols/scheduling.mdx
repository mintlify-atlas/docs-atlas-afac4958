# Scheduling & Care Coordination

CareSupport manages two types of scheduling: **Care Schedules** (recurring reminders and check-ins) and **Appointment Coordination** (one-time medical appointments and visits).

## Care Schedules Protocol

Create and manage recurring care reminders - medication times, appointment reminders, check-ins, shift handoffs.

**Safety level:** Standard  
**Requires approval:** Yes (for creating/modifying schedules)

### Two Types of Schedules

CareSupport uses two different schedule types depending on whether the task needs reasoning:

<Accordion title="Agent Schedules (needs reasoning)">
**Use when the task requires context and adaptation:**

- Daily check-ins (different questions, adapts to context)
- Wellness pattern analysis (weekly, looks at trends)
- Needs assessment (monthly, reviews if care plan needs adjustment)

**Example:**
```python
await create_care_schedule(
    family_id="family-id",
    schedule_type="agent",
    title="Morning Check-In",
    description="Read care plan, ask current caregiver about 
                 overnight. Log response.",
    cron="0 8 * * *",  # 8am daily
    notify="+15551234567",  # who to message
)
```

**How it works:**
- System wakes up at scheduled time
- Reads current care plan context
- Composes contextual message based on recent events
- Sends to appropriate caregiver
- Logs response

**Example message:**
```
Good morning Sarah 🌅
How did Mom sleep last night? I noticed she had a 
rough evening yesterday.

Reminder: PT appointment today at 2pm
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Script Schedules (deterministic)">
**Use when the task is fixed and doesn't need context:**

- Medication reminders (fixed time, fixed message)
- Appointment day-before reminders
- Shift change alerts

**Example:**
```python
await create_reminder(
    family_id="family-id",
    title="Evening Lisinopril",
    message="Time for {recipient}'s Lisinopril 10mg. 
             Reply DONE when taken ✅",
    cron="0 20 * * *",  # 8pm daily
    notify="+15551234567",
    wait_for_confirmation=True,
    escalate_after_minutes=60,  # escalate if no reply
)
```

**How it works:**
- System sends exact message at scheduled time
- Optionally waits for confirmation ("DONE")
- Can escalate to primary caregiver if no response
- No reasoning or context needed
</Accordion>

### Default Schedules Created During Onboarding

When a new family joins, these schedules are automatically created:

| Schedule | Cron | Type | Description |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| Morning check-in | `0 8 * * *` | Agent | Ask about overnight, today's plan |
| Evening check-in | `0 20 * * *` | Agent | Day summary, tomorrow's prep |
| Medication reminders | Per med schedule | Script | One per med, per time slot |
| Weekly summary | `0 10 * * 0` | Agent | Week in review to primary caregiver |

<Info>
All times are customizable per family. If someone works nights and sleeps during the day, check-ins can be rescheduled to match their rhythm.
</Info>

### Modifying Schedules

Schedules can be changed at any time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="List existing schedules">
    "What schedules do we have set up?"
    
    System lists all current schedules with times and types
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request modification">
    "Change morning check-in to 7am instead of 8am"
    
    Or: "Stop sending evening check-ins on weekends"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System drafts change">
    "Changing morning check-in from 8am to 7am. Reply YES to confirm."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="On confirmation, update executes">
    Schedule updated, change logged in care plan
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example conversation:**
```
Sarah:  Can we move the morning check-in to 7am? 
        I start work at 7:30 and want to respond before then.
        
System: Changing morning check-in from 8am to 7am. 
        Reply YES to confirm.
        
Sarah:  yes
        
System: Updated ✅ Morning check-ins will now happen at 7am 
        starting tomorrow.
```

### Quiet Hours

Respect family preferences for when NOT to send non-emergency messages:

**Default:** 10pm - 7am (no messages during these hours)

**Customizable:**
- Per family member (aide schedules may differ from family)
- Per day of week (weekends may differ from weekdays)
- Emergency protocol ALWAYS overrides quiet hours

**Example:**
```
Sarah:  Please don't text me after 9pm, I'm usually asleep
        
System: Got it. Setting quiet hours for you: 9pm - 7am. 
        I'll only message during emergencies after 9pm. 
        Reply YES to confirm.
        
Sarah:  yes
        
System: Updated ✅ No non-emergency messages to you between 9pm-7am.
```

<Warning>
**Emergency messages override quiet hours.** If someone falls or reports chest pain at 2am, ALL relevant care team members are notified immediately regardless of quiet hours.
</Warning>

## Appointment Coordination Protocol

Schedule, remind, confirm, and prepare for medical appointments.

**Safety level:** Standard  
**Requires approval:** Yes (for schedule changes)

- Includes recent changes, current concerns, questions

**After appointment:**
- Routes medication changes to medication-management protocol
- Can send follow-up messages to provider if needed
- Tracks outstanding items for next visit

**Example:**
```
System: Here's the summary for Dr. Smith's appointment:
        
        [Medication list, recent changes, questions]
        
        Want me to send this to the office ahead of time?
        
Sarah:  yes please
        
System: Sent to Dr. Smith's office at cardiology@mainstreet.com ✅
```

- Adjust times to match your family's rhythm
- Set quiet hours for each family member

**Before appointments:**

- Add questions to "For Next Visit" section anytime: "remind me to ask Dr. Smith about the dizziness"

**After appointments:**
- Report any medication or care plan changes

**You can:**
- Confirm medications with "done" or "taken"
- Report if you won't be available: "I can't take Mom to the appointment Tuesday"
- Request schedule changes: "Can we do handoff at 3pm instead of 2pm?"

## Common Schedule Patterns

### Medication Reminder Schedule

**Morning medications (8am):**
```
Script schedule, daily at 8am
Message: "Time for Mom's Lisinopril 10mg. Reply DONE when taken ✅"
Escalates to primary caregiver if no response in 1 hour
```

**Evening medications (8pm):**
```
Script schedule, daily at 8pm  
Message: "Evening meds: Metformin 500mg and Atorvastatin 40mg. Reply DONE ✅"
Escalates to primary caregiver if no response in 1 hour
```

### Check-In Schedule

**Morning check-in (8am):**
```
Agent schedule, daily at 8am
Reads care plan for context, asks current caregiver:
- How did [recipient] sleep?
- Any concerns this morning?
- Reminds of today's appointments/tasks
```

**Evening check-in (8pm):**
```
Agent schedule, daily at 8pm
Compiles day summary:
- Meal status
- Medication status  
- Mood from reports
- Tomorrow's first task
- Asks for any concerns
```

### Weekly Summary Schedule

**Sunday morning (10am):**
```
Agent schedule, weekly on Sunday at 10am
Sent to primary caregiver:
- Week in review
- Medication compliance summary
- Wellness patterns observed
- Upcoming week preview
- Any concerns to address
```

---

## Integration with Other Protocols

Scheduling works with:

- **Medication Management**: Creates and manages medication reminder schedules
- **Daily Check-In**: Agent schedules for morning and evening check-ins
- **Caregiver Handoff**: Script schedules for shift change notifications
- **Provider Communication**: Day-before and morning-of appointment reminders
- **Emergency Response**: Can pause non-emergency schedules during crises
- **Hospitalization**: Suspends home care schedules during inpatient stay
