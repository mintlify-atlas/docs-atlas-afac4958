description: Get CareSupport running in 5 minutes
---

Get CareSupport operational and send your first coordinated care message in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- API keys for OpenRouter (or Anthropic) and Linq
- A phone number for testing

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone and install dependencies">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kanoliban/caresupport-original.git
    cd caresupport-original
    pip install openai anthropic python-dotenv
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the project root:
    
    ```bash
    # AI Backend (OpenRouter recommended)
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key  # Optional: for direct Anthropic access
    
    # Linq API (iMessage/SMS gateway)
    LINQ_API_KEY=your_linq_api_key
    LINQ_DEVICE_ID=your_device_id
    
    # Project root
    CARESUPPORT_ROOT=/path/to/caresupport-original
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the SMS handler pipeline">
    Dry-run a message to verify everything works:
    
    ```bash
    python runtime/scripts/sms_handler.py \
      --from "+16515551234" \
      --body "Can someone drive Mom to her appointment tomorrow at 2pm?" \
      --dry-run
    ```
    
    You should see the full pipeline output including context loading, AI response, and enforcement checks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first family">
    Set up a test family directory:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir -p fork/workspace/families/test-family/members
    ```
    
    Create `fork/workspace/families/test-family/routing.json`:
    
    ```json
    {
      "family_id": "test-family",
      "members": {
        "+16515551234": {
          "name": "Test User",
          "role": "primary_caregiver",
          "access_level": "full"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Create `fork/workspace/families/test-family/family.md`:
    
    ```markdown
    # Test Family Care Coordination
    
    ## Current Schedule
    No schedule entries yet.
    
    ## Current Medications
    No medications tracked yet.
    
    ## Notes
    First time setup - ready for coordination.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send your first message">
    Process a real message (without --dry-run to actually send):
    
    ```bash
    python runtime/scripts/sms_handler.py \
      --from "+16515551234" \
      --body "Hello CareSupport!"
    ```
    
    The agent will:
    1. Resolve your phone number to the test family
    2. Load the family context
    3. Generate a personalized response
    4. Return the response (or send via Linq if configured)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the poller (optional)">
    For real-time message processing, run the poller in the background:
    
    ```bash
    tmux new-session -d -s caresupport \
      "python3 runtime/scripts/poll_inbound.py --interval 15"
    ```
    
    This checks for new messages every 15 seconds and processes them automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Card title="✅ Context loads" icon="file">

## Common Issues

<Accordion title="Phone number not found">
  Make sure the phone number in routing.json matches exactly (E.164 format with country code):
  - ✅ Correct: `"+16515551234"`
  - ❌ Wrong: `"651-555-1234"` or `"6515551234"`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key errors">
  Check that your .env file is in the project root and contains valid keys:
  ```bash
  # Test OpenRouter connection
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
    https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CARESUPPORT_ROOT not found">
  Set the absolute path in your .env file:
  ```bash
  CARESUPPORT_ROOT=/full/path/to/caresupport-original
  ```
  
  Or let runtime/config.py auto-detect it (works if .env is in project root).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Import errors">
  Make sure you're running commands from the project root and Python can find runtime modules:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/caresupport-original
  python runtime/scripts/sms_handler.py --help
  ```
</Accordion>
