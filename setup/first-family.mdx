title: Create Your First Family
description: Set up a family directory with members, routing, and context files
---

Families are the core organizational unit in CareSupport. Each family has its own directory containing member information, care context, and conversation history.

## What is a Family?

A **family** in CareSupport is:

- A care recipient (the person receiving care)
- A care team (family members, caregivers, providers)
- Routing configuration (phone numbers → members → roles → access levels)
- Operational data (schedules, medications, notes)
- Conversation history

All stored in a single directory under `$CARESUPPORT_ROOT/families/`.

## Family Directory Structure

```
families/
└── kano/                      # Family ID (unique identifier)
    ├── routing.json           # Phone number → member mapping
    ├── family.md              # Primary care context (always loaded)
    ├── schedule.md            # Weekly schedule
    ├── medications.md         # Active medications
    ├── timeline/              # Historical logs
    │   └── 2026-02.log
    ├── members/               # Individual member profiles (optional)
    │   ├── liban.md
    │   └── roman.md
    └── staging/               # Review and testing (advanced)
        ├── baseline/
        ├── reviews/
        └── saved/
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create family directory">
    Choose a unique family ID (lowercase, no spaces). This becomes the directory name:
    
    ```bash
    # Create family directory
    mkdir -p $CARESUPPORT_ROOT/families/kano
    cd $CARESUPPORT_ROOT/families/kano
    ```
    
    <Note>
    Family IDs should be memorable but not personally identifiable. Use nicknames, initials, or codes — not full names.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create routing.json">
    This file maps phone numbers to family members and defines their access levels:
    
    ```json routing.json
    {
      "family_id": "kano",
      "members": {
        "+16517037981": {
          "name": "Liban",
          "role": "primary_caregiver",
          "access_level": "full",
          "active": true,
          "chat_id": "linq-chat-uuid-here"
        },
        "+16516214824": {
          "name": "Roman Tefera",
          "role": "family_caregiver",
          "access_level": "schedule+meds",
          "active": true,
          "relationship": "sister of care recipient"
        },
        "+19522157878": {
          "name": "Amanti Melkamu",
          "role": "community_supporter",
          "access_level": "schedule",
          "active": true,
          "relationship": "community_helper"
        }
      },
      "care_recipient": "Degitu",
      "status": "active",
      "created": "2026-02-25",
      "notes": "Cold start. All care details to be learned through conversation."
    }
    ```
    
    ### Phone Number Format
    
    <Warning>
    Phone numbers **must** be in E.164 format: `+[country code][number]`
    
    - ✅ Correct: `"+16517037981"`
    - ❌ Wrong: `"651-703-7981"`, `"(651) 703-7981"`, `"6517037981"`
    </Warning>
    
    ### Access Levels
    
    | Level | Can See | Use For |
    |-------|---------|--------|
    | `full` | Everything | Primary caregivers, coordinators |
    | `schedule+meds` | Schedule, medications, urgent notes | Secondary caregivers, family |
    | `schedule` | Schedule and urgent notes only | Community helpers, drivers |
    | `provider` | Medical info, meds, care team | Healthcare providers |
    | `limited` | Minimal context | Extended family, occasional helpers |
    
    ### Roles
    
    - `primary_caregiver` — Main coordinator, approves care changes
    - `family_caregiver` — Family member involved in care
    - `paid_caregiver` — Professional caregiver or aide
    - `community_supporter` — Volunteer, neighbor, friend
    - `provider` — Doctor, nurse, therapist
    - `agency` — Home care agency, case manager
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create family.md">
    This is the primary context file loaded for every message. Use the template from `fork/workspace/families/template/family.md`:
    
    ```bash
    cp $CARESUPPORT_ROOT/families/template/family.md family.md
    ```
    
    Then edit with your family's information:
    
    ```markdown family.md
    ---
    family_id: "kano"
    created: "2026-02-25"
    last_updated: "2026-02-25T05:00:00Z"
    primary_caregiver: "+16517037981"
    care_recipient: "Degitu"
    status: active

    ## Emergency Protocols
    
    ### Fall
    1. Stay with care recipient. Do NOT move them.
    2. Check: head impact? Bleeding? On blood thinners?
    3. If head impact → call 911.
    4. Notify ALL full-access members.
    ```
    
    <Note>
    The `family.md` file uses markdown for human readability. The agent reads this file on every message to understand the current care context.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: Create member profiles">
    For families with complex relationships or specific member context:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir members
    ```
    
    Create individual profiles:
    
    ```markdown members/liban.md
    # Liban
    
    **Role:** Primary caregiver and coordinator  
    **Access Level:** Full  
    **Phone:** +16517037981  
    **Relationship:** Nephew of Degitu
    
    ## Background
    - Works full-time but coordinates all care
    - Main point of contact for providers
    - Lives nearby, visits daily
    
    ## Communication Preferences
    - Prefers text over calls
    - Available 7am-11pm
    - iMessage preferred
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test phone resolution">
    Verify CareSupport can resolve phone numbers to family members:
    
    ```bash
    python runtime/scripts/sms_handler.py \
      --from "+16517037981" \
      --body "test" \
      --dry-run
    ```
    
    You should see:
    ```json
    {
      "family_id": "kano",
      "member_name": "Liban",
      "role": "primary_caregiver",
      "access_level": "full"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send your first message">
    Send a real message through the system:
    
    ```bash
    # Inbound message processing
    python runtime/scripts/sms_handler.py \
      --from "+16517037981" \
      --body "Can you remind Roman about the appointment tomorrow?"
    ```
    
    The system will:
    1. Resolve +16517037981 → Liban (kano family, full access)
    2. Load `family.md` context
    3. Generate response using AI
    4. Return the reply (you handle sending via Linq)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Access Control

Access levels determine what each member can see from `family.md`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="full">
    **Sees everything:**
    - Care recipient details
    - Full care team
    - Schedule, medications
    - Insurance, financial notes
    - All conversations
    - Emergency protocols
    
    **Can approve:**
    - Medication changes

    - Urgent notes
    - Emergency protocols
    
    **Cannot see:**
    - Insurance information

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="limited">
    **Sees:**
    - Care recipient name
    - Urgent notes (if tagged for all levels)
    - Emergency contact
    
    **Use for:**
    - Extended family with minimal involvement
    - Occasional helpers
    - People you're still evaluating
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

```
</CodeGroup>

### Usage

Liban sends:
> "Can Amanti take auntie to work tomorrow morning?"

CareSupport:
1. Resolves +16517037981 → Liban (full access)
2. Loads family.md context
3. Sees Amanti in care team with schedule access
4. Generates response:

> "I'll check with Amanti about tomorrow morning's ride to work. Degitu needs to be there by 8am, so pickup around 7:30am."

Then messages Amanti (+19522157878) with schedule-filtered context.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can one phone number be in multiple families?">
    Yes. A caregiver can be part of multiple families (e.g., caring for both parents). The system resolves to the correct family based on conversation context or explicit family ID.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if someone texts from an unknown number?">
    Unknown numbers are not routed to any family. You can either:
    1. Add them to `routing.json` with appropriate access level
    2. Create a new family for them
    3. Ignore (no response sent)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change access levels later?">
    Yes. Edit `routing.json` and update the `access_level` field. Changes take effect immediately on the next message.
    
    ```json
    "+16516214824": {
      "access_level": "full"  // Changed from schedule+meds
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between routing.json and family.md?">
    - **routing.json** — WHO can message (phone → member mapping, access control)
    - **family.md** — WHAT they're coordinating (care context, schedules, notes)
    
    `routing.json` is for authentication/authorization. `family.md` is operational data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to create schedule.md and medications.md?">
    No. These are optional. You can put everything in `family.md` initially. As the family grows, you can split into separate files:
    
    - `schedule.md` — Weekly schedules, recurring appointments
    - `medications.md` — Active medications, refill tracking
    - `members/` — Individual member profiles
    
    The agent loads these on demand when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is 'cold start'?">
    **Cold start** means the family file starts nearly empty — just names and phone numbers. The CareSupport agent learns everything through conversation:
    
    - Schedules are added when someone mentions them
    - Medications are recorded when discussed
    - Relationships emerge from context
    
    This is faster than pre-filling everything manually, and often more accurate because it captures what actually matters to the family.
