# Network Types and Use Cases

## Core Thesis

CareSupport is **network-specific infrastructure** that equips each **care network** to manage its care team effectively—**built for the whole network, with a Coordination Lead role (can be held by any member)**.

Instead of universal protocols for everyone at once, we deliver specialized coordination tools tuned to **family networks**, **independent caregiver networks**, **agency networks**, and **platform networks**.

<Info>
**The Insight:** Care coordination fails not from lack of compassion, but from lack of **coordination context**. Existing systems capture *state* (who's assigned to what shift) but not *reasoning* (why Sarah was assigned instead of James, what alternatives were considered, what exceptions were made).
</Info>

---

## Network Types Overview

We focus on distinct care networks—how coordination is arranged and who benefits. The **Coordination Lead is a role**, not a fixed person; it can be held by the care recipient, a family member, a professional, or shared/rotating.

## Family Networks

### Who Coordinates + Who Benefits

**Coordinated by:** Care recipient or family member (e.g., Rob; Marta as backup)  
**Benefits:** Entire family care team (15 caregivers + family)  
**Primary Coordination Need:** Unified view of all caregivers regardless of source  
**Infrastructure:** **Family Platform** (pro-integrated)

### Real Example: Rob's Network

Rob is quadriplegic and coordinates his own care team of ~15 people:
- 9 professional caregivers from 3 different home care agencies
- Family members (mother Marta, sister, others)

**The Problem Before CareSupport:**

The three agencies don't speak to each other. They all use Rob as the proxy for his own care. When someone texts "I can't make it Saturday evening," Rob has to manually search through 15 contacts to find who can backfill. He coordinates his own life-or-death care from a phone he operates with his nose.

<Accordion title="How Family Platform Helps Rob">
  **Coverage Visibility:** Rob sees all caregivers from all three agencies in one unified schedule

  **Gap Detection:** System automatically detects when someone cancels and identifies available backfill candidates

  **Coordination Automation:** Instead of manually texting 15 people, Rob confirms one AI-generated proposal

  **Handoff Continuity:** Each caregiver sees notes from the previous shift, regardless of which agency they're from

  **Backup Coordinator:** Marta can step in when Rob needs rest, with full context preservation

## Independent Caregiver Networks

### Who Coordinates + Who Benefits

**Coordinated by:** Independent caregiver (e.g., Sarah)  
**Benefits:** All families they serve (multi-family practice)  
**Primary Coordination Need:** Professional tools for managing multiple families  
**Infrastructure:** **CareGiver OS**

### The CareGiver OS Vision

**CareGiver OS** (capital "G") elevates independent professionals to a **professional identity** with tools to manage **multi-family networks**.

<Note>
Independent caregivers currently juggle multiple families using group texts, paper logs, and memory. They have no professional operating system. CareGiver OS provides the infrastructure they need to run a sustainable, high-quality multi-family practice.
</Note>

### Real Example: Sarah's Multi-Family Practice

Sarah is an independent professional caregiver serving 4 families:
- The Rodriguez family (medication management, meals)
- The Chen family (mobility assistance, appointments)
- The Williams family (overnight care)
- The Johnson family (weekend respite)

<Accordion title="How CareGiver OS Helps Sarah">
  **Multi-Family Schedule:** Sarah sees all her commitments across families in one unified view

  **Session Logging:** Quick voice-based session summaries that automatically appear in each family's timeline

  **Availability Management:** Sarah sets her hours once; system prevents invalid assignments across all families

  **Care Checklists:** Templates for common care tasks (medication admin, mobility assist) with family-specific customizations

  **Business Operations:** Invoicing, payouts, tax reports, compliance signatures—all built in

  **Professional Profile:** Verified credentials, certifications, reputation vault that travels with Sarah across families

## Agency Networks

### Who Coordinates + Who Benefits

**Coordinated by:** Agency coordination lead/manager  
**Benefits:** Agency workforce + Linked Circle families  
**Primary Coordination Need:** Enterprise ops with family connectivity  
**Infrastructure:** **Agency Platform**

### The Agency Integration Challenge

Home care agencies already have their own scheduling, HR, payroll, and EVV systems. They don't want to replace their entire stack. What they need is **seamless family connectivity** without heavy integration work.

<Info>
**Solution:** CareSupport provides a **Linked Circle** model—agencies keep their existing systems, CareSupport synchronizes the family view through minimal adapters (CSV/ICS/API-lite).
</Info>

### Real Example: Rob's Three Agencies

Rob receives care from three different home care agencies. Each agency:
- Schedules their own caregivers in their own system
- Has their own HR, payroll, and compliance processes
- Communicates with Rob independently

Before CareSupport, the agencies never spoke to each other. Rob was the integration layer.

<Accordion title="How Agency Platform Helps Rob's Agencies">
  **Shared Timeline:** All three agencies see the same unified family timeline (with scoped access)

  **Minimal Integration:** CSV export or ICS feed from agency system → auto-sync to family view

  **Incident Routing:** When something goes wrong during a shift, it routes to the right agency coordinator automatically

  **Reduced Support Load:** Family can see shift status directly instead of calling agency office

  **Network Health Metrics:** Agency sees measurable reduction in coordinator calls, improved coverage %, higher NPS

## Platform Networks

### Who Coordinates + Who Benefits

**Coordinated by:** Platform operations or shared leads  
**Benefits:** Matched families + caregivers post-match  
**Primary Coordination Need:** Post-match coordination infrastructure  
**Infrastructure:** **Platform Integration (APIs + tools)**

### The Platform Use Case

Marketplaces like Care.com, Papa, Honor excel at **matching** families with caregivers. But post-match coordination—scheduling, handoffs, incident management—is where relationships often fail.

<Note>
**Opportunity:** Platforms can use CareSupport as the **coordination layer** that activates after the match, improving retention and reducing post-match churn.
</Note>

### Real Example: Care.com Match → CareSupport Handoff

Family finds Sarah on Care.com. Match happens. Now what?

**Before CareSupport:**
- Family and Sarah coordinate via text messages and phone calls
- No shared schedule, no handoff notes, no incident tracking
- High churn—many matches fail within first 30 days

**With CareSupport Integration:**

<Accordion title="Post-Match Coordination Flow">
  1. **Match Completion:** Care.com match confirmed
  2. **CareSupport Handoff:** "Powered by CareSupport" prompt appears
  3. **Shared Timeline Creation:** Family + Sarah onboard into shared coordination space
  4. **Immediate Value:** First session logged, handoff captured, schedule visible
  5. **Higher Retention:** Measurable reduction in 30-day churn
</Accordion>

### Platform Integration Features

  <Card title="API Integration" icon="code">
    RESTful APIs for match data, status updates, incident notifications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Integration" icon="credit-card">

## Differentiation

### What Makes CareSupport Different

**One-liner:** *We equip each care network with network-specific infrastructure.*

<Info>
**The Context Graph Advantage:** CareSupport sits in the **orchestration path** for care coordination. Every gap detection, candidate evaluation, assignment, acceptance, and handoff flows through the system. This means we capture **decision traces** as they happen—not reconstructed from logs after the fact.
</Info>

### Why Incumbents Can't Replicate This

- **Agency systems** store shift state, not coordination reasoning—that happens in the coordinator's head or on phone calls
- **Family apps** store tasks and calendars, not why tasks were assigned to whom
- **Marketplaces** store matches, not post-match coordination context

To capture decision traces, incumbents would need to rebuild their architecture from the ground up and insert themselves into coordination workflows they currently don't touch. This is a multi-year structural disadvantage.
