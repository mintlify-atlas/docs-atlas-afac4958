# Product Roadmap

## Current State (2026-02-26)

CareSupport runs as a **single-family pilot (Kano family)**. One care recipient (Degitu), one registered member (Liban), SMS via Linq/iMessage. Files are the database. No self-service onboarding. No multi-family routing beyond directory scanning.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What's Proven" icon="check" color="#00A67E">
    - 13-step SMS pipeline works end-to-end
    - Approval gating blocks sensitive changes until confirmed
    - PHI filtering, role-based access, audit logging all mechanical
    - Family.md + member profiles update through conversation
    - Outreach queuing (needs_outreach → Linq create_chat) works
  </Card>
  <Card title="What's Broken" icon="exclamation-triangle" color="#F59E0B">
    - Agent asks excessive clarifying questions instead of acting on clear input
    - 6 family members listed with phone numbers → 0 added to routing.json
    - Pending approval for care recipient update → user hasn't been prompted to confirm
    - No per-family learning — corrections are global only
    - Relationship context stored as single field (to care recipient), not member-to-member
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Implementation Strategy: Land → Pro → Agency

**The Expansion Sequence:** Land with Family → pull in Pro via invites → bring in Agency with shared-timeline proof. Seed each step with **clear wins**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: Land with Family">
    Prove coordination value inside a single **Family Circle**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 2: Pull in Pro">
    Enable a professional to coordinate **multi-family work** while plugging into the family's Circle
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 3: Bring in Agency">
    Demonstrate value to the agency **without heavy integration**
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Phase 0: Fix the Pilot (Now)

### Goal

Make the Kano family work properly before scaling anything.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Conversation Skills" icon="comments">
    **What:** Add `skill.md` — social skills that guide conversation flow
    
    **Why:** Agent should prompt "Want me to invite them?" after receiving member list, not ask 3 more clarifying questions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Prioritization" icon="list-ol">
    **What:** Define mandatory vs optional fields in family.md and member.md
    
    **Why:** Agent wastes turns asking for blood type when it should be saving the 6 phone numbers it already has
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-Family Lessons" icon="graduation-cap">
    **What:** Add `families/{id}/lessons.md` — local corrections
    
    **Why:** "Degitu prefers Auntie" shouldn't leak to other families; "always confirm before adding members" should be global
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resolve Pending State" icon="circle-check">
    **What:** Clear the pending approval backlog, add the 6 family members
    
    **Why:** The pilot is stuck because the agent over-gated a straightforward update
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

    Family → Invite Pro (SMS/email)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pro Joins">
    Pro joins **CareGiver OS** → sets availability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receives Assignments">
    Pro receives assignments → logs sessions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sends Summaries">

### Multi-Family Architecture

Make the system capable of running 2+ families without operator intervention.

| Item | Challenge |
|------|----------|
| **Family creation CLI** | `python scripts/create_family.py --name "tefera" --coordinator "+1..."` — Seed routing.json, family.md, member profile from templates |
| **SMS self-service signup** | New number texts in → "Start a care network" flow — Need to distinguish new family vs existing member on unknown number |
| **Cross-family isolation** | One member in 2 families (e.g., caregiver serves multiple) — routing.json currently maps phone → one family. Need multi-family resolution |
| **Global lesson graduation** | Local lesson appears in 2+ families → promote to global — Need a review mechanism, not automatic (family-specific context could be wrong globally) |

<Note>
**Trigger to Phase 3:** Pro/Family references an agency OR backup staffing need emerges → **Share Timeline with Agency** prompt.
</Note>

## Scaling Challenges

### Challenge 1: Scaling Families

<Accordion title="Problem & Constraints">
  **Problem:** Every new family requires manual directory creation, routing.json seeding, family.md templating, first-message-via-Linq to establish chat_id. This is 6 manual steps that require operator knowledge.

  **Why it's hard:**
  - Phone number is the primary key, but one person can be in multiple families
  - Chat_id (Linq's UUID) is only known after first message — chicken-and-egg
  - Template family.md has sections that may not apply to every family (not everyone tracks medications)
  - No rollback if onboarding fails halfway

  **Constraints:**
  - Must work over SMS (no web UI for onboarding)
  - Must preserve file-as-database architecture (no external DB)
  - Must maintain approval gating for sensitive data from day one
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Proposed Approach">
  1. **CLI tool first** (operator-assisted, Phase 2)
  2. **SMS self-service second** (fully automated, Phase 2 stretch)
  3. **Web dashboard third** (Phase 3+, only if needed)
</Accordion>

### Challenge 2: Context Explosion

<Accordion title="Problem & Approach">
  **Problem:** As families grow, the amount of context loaded per message grows. family.md Current section has a 2000-token soft limit, but with 7+ members, active medications, and weekly schedules, it'll exceed that.

  **Why it's hard:**
  - Every message loads Current section in full
  - Agent needs enough context to be useful but not so much it hallucinates
  - Different messages need different context (schedule question vs medication question)

  **Proposed approach:** Mandatory/optional framework and intent-based context loading.
</Accordion>

### Challenge 3: Conversation Quality at Scale

<Accordion title="Problem & Approach">
  **Problem:** CareSupport's conversation quality depends on prompt engineering in SOUL.md + capabilities.md. As we add families with different dynamics, a single prompt may not generalize.

  **Why it's hard:**
  - Each family has different communication norms
  - Some families are terse, some are verbose
  - Cultural context matters (naming conventions, family structure, communication expectations)
  - Global lessons from one family may not apply to another

  **Proposed approach:** Per-family `skill.md` for conversation patterns + per-family `lessons.md` for corrections. Global lessons only for universal patterns.
</Accordion>

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Cold start in multi-sided network** | Need families *and* pros *and* partners | Stage GTM; seed Family Hubs; recruit pros via value props; pilot partners |
| **Integration friction** | Agencies/marketplaces are busy, legacy stacks | Provide adapters, playbooks, commercial incentives (retention/NPS lift) |
| **Compliance variability by state** | Product behavior must adapt | Policy graph + jurisdiction packs; local counsel & templates |
| **Perception as competitor** | Partners may fear overlap | Strict neutral posture; published interoperability charter; white-label options |
| **Data trust & privacy** | Must be trusted by families and pros | Transparent controls, consent receipts, minimal data exposure by default |
